        <h3>Welcome to your introductory git-class!</h3>

        <p class="teacher-intro-text">
            To go through the basics we will be using this test-repo that I created 
            to get a look at github-pages.

            We will use it so you can try out basic operations and get an initial
            view on parts of the workflow that git uses.
        </p>
        <p class="teacher-intro-text">
            We will:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    get stuff from an online-repo, change things locally, and then 
                    put those changes back into the online-repo
                </li>
                <li>
                    make branches, bring different branches together
                </li>
                <li>
                    provoke some conflict, solve the conflict
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="teacher-intro-text">
            Maybe we even learn how to customize git a little bit more to our needs!
